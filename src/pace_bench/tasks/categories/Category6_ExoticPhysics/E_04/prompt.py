TASK_PROMPT = {
    "task_description": """
Design a complex structure that remains intact under sinusoidally varying mass and environmental vibration.

- **Wind Pressure**: The environment may apply lateral wind pressure. Wind pressure may differ from nominal (discoverable via feedback).
- **Mass Variation**: Every beam's mass varies over time according to sinusoidal frequency components; the phase of mass oscillation varies with beam position along the structure. The dominant mass variation frequency and secondary frequency, along with their amplitude ratios and the spatial phase gradient, are nominal values; these parameters may differ from nominal (discoverable via feedback).
- **Base Excitation**: The ground support oscillates vertically and horizontally in an elliptical pattern. The vertical amplitude, horizontal amplitude, and driving frequency are nominal values; these parameters may differ from nominal (discoverable via feedback).
- **Fatigue**: Joint strength (force and torque limits) decay exponentially over time with a nominal time constant τ = 100.0 s: effective_limit = nominal × exp(-t/τ). The time constant τ (how quickly limits erode) may differ from nominal (discoverable via feedback).
- **Joint Limits (nominal)**: Joints fail if reaction force exceeds 6.0 N or reaction torque exceeds 10.0 N·m (before fatigue decay).
- **Beam Size**: Each beam's width and height are independently bounded: width and height each between 0.1 m and 4.0 m.
- **Build Zone**: x in [5.0, 15.0] m, y in [1.5, 8.0] m.
- **Simulation Duration**: The run lasts for 12000 simulation steps. Success is evaluated at the end of the run; the structure must remain intact for the entire simulation.
- **Goal**: Maintain structural integrity until the end of the simulation.

Design a structure that:
1. Spans from x=6.0m to x=14.0m.
2. Uses at least 5 beams and 6 joints.
3. Must include at least one pivot (revolute) joint.
4. Withstands the varying inertial loads and base vibration without breaking any joints.

    "success_criteria": """

1. **Integrity**: All joints remain intact throughout the simulation.
2. **Simulation Length**: Structure must remain intact for the full simulation duration.
3. **Span**: Structure spans from at least x <= 6.0m to x >= 14.0m.
4. **Complexity**: Meets the minimum beam (5) and joint (6) counts.
5. **Variety**: At least one joint must be a pivot (`type='pivot'`).

- **Mass Budget**: Total structure mass (instantaneous) must remain within 400 kg.
- **Beam Count**: At least 5 beams are required.
- **Joint Count**: At least 6 joints are required.
- **Pivot Requirement**: At least one joint must be a pivot (`type='pivot'`).
- **Span Left**: At least one beam center must have x ≤ 6.0 m.
- **Span Right**: At least one beam center must have x ≥ 14.0 m.
- **Build Zone**: All beams must be placed within x ∈ [5.0, 15.0] m, y ∈ [1.5, 8.0] m.
- **Beam Size**: Each beam's width and height are each independently bounded between 0.1 m and 4.0 m.
- **APIs**: Use only the primitives documented below.
