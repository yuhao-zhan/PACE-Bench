The Initial agent's standard design weighs approximately 278 kg and fails the mass check instantly at step 0 — it cannot even begin operation. The agent must discover that structural integrity in Box2D is independent of density, allowing extreme weight reduction without compromising strength. Every beam, the tower, and the scoop must use densities 10-100x below standard values. This is not a parameter tweak — it is a fundamental re-engineering: the tower at default density alone exceeds the entire budget, so every component must be rethought. Standard motor torque (3000 Nm) remains sufficient for the ultra-light mechanism, but the real challenge is designing a 2-DOF excavator that weighs less than a single standard beam. The scoop and arm must still collect and transport at least 15 particles within 40 seconds.",

Damping quadrupled to 4x normal (0.08) makes all motion extremely sluggish, sapping energy from every movement. Particle friction dropped to near-zero (0.04) so grains behave like ice on glass, sliding out of the scoop at the slightest tilt or acceleration. Combined with maximum pit drift (1.0) that aggressively pushes particles rightward away from the scoop zone, capturing any material becomes a precision operation requiring exact scoop positioning and gentle transport. Scoop capacity limited to a mere 8 particles per trip forces at least 4 complete cycles. Mass budget slashed to 120 kg — the standard 278 kg design fails the mass check instantly and cannot even be built. Only 20 seconds to deliver 30+ particles — the standard 10 s cycle would complete at most 2 trips, collecting at most 16 particles, nowhere near the 30 required. This is a multi-dimensional trap: doubled gravity demands powerful motors, but the mass budget forbids heavy construction; near-zero friction and max drift demand impossibly precise scoop control under quadruple damping; and the capacity-time squeeze (8/trip, 30 target, 20s) demands fast, precise cycles.",

Damping at 5x normal (0.10) — 25% beyond Stage-3's 4x — smothers all motion in viscous resistance, demanding higher motor torque just to achieve normal speeds. Particle friction of 0.02 is half of Stage-3's 0.04, turning grains into near-frictionless spheres that slide off the scoop at the slightest tilt or acceleration. Pit drift of 1.2 — 20% stronger than Stage-3's 1.0 — accelerates particle evacuation, shortening the viable excavation window. Scoop capacity limited to 6 particles per trip (vs Stage-3's 8) demands at least 4 complete trips to reach 22 particles, all within 17 seconds (3 seconds less than Stage-3's 20 s). Mass budget of 100 kg — 17% tighter than Stage-3's 120 kg — requires a leaner design. Every parameter is strictly worse than Stage-3: stronger gravity, heavier damping, slipperier particles, stronger drift, smaller capacity, tighter mass, and less time. The conflicting extremes create a brutal optimization problem: gravity demands power but mass is forbidden; drift demands speed but damping prevents it; small capacity needs many trips but time is short; slippery particles need precise control but viscous damping makes precision difficult.",
