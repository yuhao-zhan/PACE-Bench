    "task_description": """
Design a control strategy to pump a swing seat to reach a target zone.

- **Swing Seat**: A heavy body attached to a fixed pivot at (10, 10) m by a cable of length 4 m (seat vertical range: 6 m to 14 m). The seat is subject to linear and angular damping; its dynamic response must be inferred from feedback.
- **Wind**: Environmental wind forces act on the seat as a horizontal force. In the initial environment the wind follows a sinusoidal pattern: F_x = wind_strength * sin(2*pi*t / wind_period), where the period must be inferred from feedback. Additionally, random wind gusts may occur with probability that must be inferred from feedback.
- **Target Zone**: y >= 11.7 m, x in [9.35, 10.65] m.
- **Build Zone**: Any structure (e.g. beams) must be placed within x in [6, 14] m, y in [4, 10] m.
- **Pump Force Limit**: Maximum 42 N horizontal and vertical force per step.
- **Step Limit**: Success must be achieved within 15000 simulation steps; the run terminates after this limit and failure is declared if the target is not reached by then.

Design a controller that:
1. Pumps the swing by applying forces.
2. Accounts for wind forces and timing.
3. Energy control to reach the target zone at the apex or through vertical fall.

1. **Target**: Seat reaches the target zone (y >= 11.7 m, x in [9.35, 10.65] m) either (a) at the apex (speed < 1.0 m/s), or (b) via vertical fall into the zone after an apex (|vx| < 1.35 m/s, vy <= 0).

- **Mass Budget**: Total structure mass must be less than 100 kg.
- **Build Zone**: Structure must be built within x = [6, 14] m, y = [4, 10] m.
- **Beam Size**: Each beam dimension (width, height) is clamped to [0.1, 3.0] m.
- **Pump Force**: |fx|, |fy| <= 42 N per step.
- **Impulse Limit**: Applied impulse via apply_impulse_to_seat is clamped per component; effective limit is 4.2 N·s per axis.
- **Quadratic Damping**: The environment may apply a speed-squared drag force to the swing seat; no such drag is active in the initial environment.
- **Dead Zone**: The force actuators may exhibit a spatial dead zone in which force application is suppressed unless the seat's horizontal speed exceeds a minimum threshold. In the initial environment no dead zone is active.
- **Actuator Fault**: The force actuators may fail to produce thrust in one or more directions. In the initial environment no actuator fault is active.
- **Wind System**: Wind is always enabled; wind properties (period, gust probability) must be inferred from feedback.
- **Step Limit**: The task is evaluated over at most 15000 simulation steps; you must achieve success within this limit.
- **APIs**: Use only the primitives documented below.
