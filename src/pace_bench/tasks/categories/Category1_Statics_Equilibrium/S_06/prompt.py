Stack blocks on a table to create the longest possible overhang beyond the edge.
This task tests your ability to manage the Center of Mass and utilize friction effectively.
You cannot use joints or any form of artificial bonding. The structure must rely entirely on gravity and friction between surfaces.

- **Table**: A horizontal surface extending from x=-20 to x=0. The table edge is at x=0.
- **Table Height**: The table surface is at y=0.0.
- **Surface Properties**: Both the table and the blocks provide friction, which you must utilize to stabilize the stack.
- **Table Friction**: mu_table = 0.8 (friction between blocks and the table surface).
- **Block Friction**: mu_block = 0.6 (friction between stacked blocks).
- **Goal**: Reach x >= 0.1m beyond the edge.
- **Block Dimensions**: width <= 1.0m, height <= 0.2m.
- **Spawn Rule**: Blocks must be initialized within the permitted build access zone: x in [-10.0, 0.0].
- **Block Count**: You are limited to a maximum of 100 blocks.
- **Mass Budget**: Total structure mass must be less than or equal to 20000.0 units.
- **Support Boundary**: If any part of the structure falls below the safe support boundary, the structure is considered to have left the table surface and the task fails.
- **Ceiling Boundary**: Structure cannot exceed y = 100.0m in height.

    'success_criteria': """

1. **Static Stability**: The structure remains upright and relatively motionless for at least 10 seconds.
2. **Reach**: The horizontal extent of any part of the stack exceeds the table edge (Tip reaches x >= 0.1m).

- **Primitive Limits**: Max block width = 1.0m, Max block height = 0.2m.
- **Block Count**: Maximum of 100 blocks.
- **Mass Budget**: Total mass must be <= 20000.0 units.
- **Stability Time**: Structure must remain motionless for at least 10.0 seconds.
- **Start Zone / Build Access Zone**: All block centers must be placed within x in [-10.0, 0.0].
- **APIs**: Use only the primitives documented below.
